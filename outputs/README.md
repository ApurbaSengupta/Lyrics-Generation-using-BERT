1.  To run BERT last word prediction, run the Jupyter notebook last-word-bert.ipynb and give the         appropriate path to test_rock.csv and save results in test_gold_file.txt and                         test_pred_file.txt in outputs/nextword

2.  To run BERT rhyming, run the Jupyter notebook rhymings.ipynb and give the appropriate path to        test_rock.csv and save results in test_gold_file.txt and test_pred_file.txt in outputs/rhymings

3.  To run reconstruction, run the Jupyter notebook reconstruction.ipynb and give the appropriate        path to test_rock.csv and save results in test_gold_file.txt and test_pred_file.txt in               outputs/reconstruction
