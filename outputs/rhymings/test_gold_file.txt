[CLS] when a law prevented him from succeeding himself [SEP] he ran his wife le ##rlin ##e in his place and she won .

[CLS] was viewed as a man from another time and place [SEP] and when i first ventured out of the south , i was . [SEP] shocked at how strongly wallace was associated [SEP] with alabama and its people ya know racism is a . [SEP] worldwide problem and it ' s been since the [SEP]

[CLS] beginning of recorded history and it ain ' t [SEP] just white and black but thanks to george . [SEP] wallace , it ' s always a little more convenient to [SEP] play it with a southern accent . and bands like . [SEP] l ##yn ##yr ##d sky ##ny ##rd attempted to show another side of [SEP]

[CLS] government . and wallace spent the rest of his life [SEP] trying to explain away his racist past , and in . [SEP] 1982 won his last term in office with over 90 % of [SEP] the black vote such is the dual ##ity of the . [SEP] southern thing and george wallace died back in [SEP]

[CLS] ' 98 and he ' s in hell now , not because he ' s a [SEP] racist his track record as a judge and his . [SEP] late - life quest for redemption make a good [SEP] argument for his being , at worst , no worse than . [SEP] most white men of his generation , north or [SEP]
