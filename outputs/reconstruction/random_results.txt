Never again, never again,   You changed your mind,
Shove all your problems under the rug   Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.
Then you wonder where the smell came from   Rotting out...Rotting out
Rotting out from the inside Rotting out...Rotting out
This is your fucked up family   Not gonna let it happen to me, no
So many minds that nobody ever speaks   Then you wonder where the smell came from
Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.  Winter forever in this house, they're
Nuclear family falling out  So many minds that nobody ever speaks
Winter forever in this house, they're   Not gonna let it happen to me, no
So put me out of my misery  Beat my head till I can speak
If it ever happens to me, no    Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.
Rotting out from the inside...rotting out   Beat my head till I can speak
Rotting out...Rotting out   Rotting out from the inside
Beat my head till I can speak   So many minds that nobody ever speaks
Not gonna let it happen to me, no   Rotting out from the inside
I am alone in a stranger's bad dream    Is my imagination the only meaning?
I don't know what any of this means In any moment, it's breaking around me
I see the the signals, I feel the world bending Everyone is over....
In any moment, it's breaking around me  I don't know what any of this means
It's a matter of time   I see the the signals, I feel the world bending
What ya gonna to do if I step out of line?  I'm crossing rivers, and hoping I don't drown.
I'm crossing fingers and hoping life works out  I'm crossing rivers, and hoping I don't drown.
I'm crossing rivers, and hoping I don't drown.  Everyone is over....
I see the imitation, I feel the ending  Everyone is over....
Tell me what it means   It's a matter of time
Is my imagination the only meaning? It's all in my mind
Everyone is over. Everyone is overcome. I don't know what any of this means
It's all in my mind I see the the signals, I feel the world bending
Outside the barracks by the corner light    There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you
Darling I remember how I'd wait for you at night    My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene
There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you Outside the barracks by the corner light
The whole night through, was there that you'd whisper tenderly  Outside the barracks by the corner light
That you loved me, you'd always be  I'd give you a rose to show I care,
Be my Lili Marlene, be my Lili Marlene  And wind it through your golden hair
I'd give you a rose to show I care, There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you
And wind it through your golden hair    I'd give you a rose to show I care,
Then we would say goodnight and part,   That you loved me, you'd always be
I'll always keep you in my heart    And wind it through your golden hair
With me Lili Marlene, with me Lili Marlene  Be my Lili Marlene, be my Lili Marlene
On a long lonesome journey I'm going    The plans that we made were in vain
Oh darling, and please don't you cry    And I long for your kisses in vain
Though in shackles and chains they will take me In heartache, you're my consolation
In prison to stay till I die    Let me kiss those sweet lips that I love best
And at night through the bars, I gaze at the stars  In heartache, you're my consolation
And I long for your kisses in vain  A piece of stone I will use as my pillow
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow   In prison to stay till I die
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains   And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars
Put your arms through these bars once, my darlin'   In prison to stay till I die
Let me kiss those sweet lips that I love best   While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains
In heartache, you're my consolation And I long for your kisses in vain
In sorrow, my haven of rest On a long lonesome journey I'm going
And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars Put your arms through these bars once, my darlin'
The plans that we made were in vain Let me kiss those sweet lips that I love best
A piece of stone I will use as my pillow    In heartache, you're my consolation
It was somewhere around Sheffield where my conscious concedes   Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh
Fiction halts, the drugs began to wear thin, oh So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick
Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt   This show has been going downhill since season one
Waking up each night from the gravitational pull    Undone in the middle of the night, stinkingly obvious
What is the sound of something trying not to make a sound?  Long and clever titles doesn't bring a clever song
So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick    Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late? Waking up each night from the gravitational pull
Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious    Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt
Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh   Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious
The last horse has finally crossed the finish line, yeah    Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?
Long and clever titles doesn't bring a clever song  This show has been going downhill since season one
This show has been going downhill since season one  The last horse has finally crossed the finish line, yeah
Just an open book reading itself to sleep   Waking up each night from the gravitational pull
Undone in the middle of the night, stinkingly obvious   Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh
Seen how you treat her  There's nothing left in my home
Don't wanna turn out like you   Not anymore
So well adjusted    Not anymore
You leave me feeling confused   Anymore
I've wasted I'm not going back
The last seventeen years of my life Anymore
I'm not going back  There's nothing left in my home
But I'm not gonna run away  Cracks in the in mirror
Anymore I've wasted
Not anymore Blank photo pages
Under the carpet    The last seventeen years of my life
You know the things that kids say   You leave me feeling confused
Cracks in the in mirror There's nothing left in my home
Words in a darkened hallway The last seventeen years of my life
All I remember  So well adjusted
Spending December alone The last seventeen years of my life
Blank photo pages   You know the things that kids say
You don't want to know  For always pushing my luck
But that won't stop me from showing Should I be so bold
For nights I drank too much If I'm not good enough for now
And words exchanged in the morning  But maybe tomorrow
For always pushing my luck  You'll wake up to find out
Expecting you to keep waiting   I want to be faithful
I want to be faithful   If I'm not good enough for now
But as far as I can tell    And words exchanged in the morning
I'm not doing so well...thus far    For nights I drank too much
But maybe tomorrow  Should I be so bold
You'll wake up to find out  I want to be faithful
If I'm not good enough for now  But maybe tomorrow
I'm good enough to wait for you For always pushing my luck
What have you been told And words exchanged in the morning
What are you so afraid of   But that won't stop me from showing
Should I be so bold If I'm not good enough for now
I'd like to love you , with all of my heart And it's in your smile, and it's in the way
You've had me on your trip, right from the start    But I felt so close to you, when you said hello
And when you looked at me, with love in your eyes   You've had me on your trip, right from the start
I knew I'd want you, oh yeah    And when you looked at me, with love in your eyes
I'd like to hold you, if you want me to The place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mind
I've found something new girl, just by looking at you   The place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mind
And it's in your smile, and it's in the way There we'll be happy, and there I'll know why
I meet so many people, I feel I don't know  And it's in your smile, and it's in the way
But I felt so close to you, when you said hello I've found something new girl, just by looking at you
I'd like to love you, and together we'd find    And it's in your smile, and it's in the way
The place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mind  I'd like to love you , with all of my heart
There we'll be happy, and there I'll know why   I knew I'd want you, oh yeah
Chosen thing, I have become In my dying time, you're all that is real.
Broken stave, and overrun.  Servant to, what's offering,
In my dying time my wounds shall all be healed. Servant to, what's offering,
Servant to, what's offering,    The poisoned ground, I've fallen in.
The poisoned ground, I've fallen in.    In my dying time my wounds shall all be healed.
In my dying time, you're all that is real.  In my dying time my wounds shall all be healed.
