Shove all your problems under the rug   Winter forever in this house, they're
Then you wonder where the smell came from   Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.
Rotting out from the inside Rotting out...Rotting out
This is your fucked up family   Shove all your problems under the rug
So many minds that nobody ever speaks   Winter forever in this house, they're
Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.  Winter forever in this house, they're
Nuclear family falling out  Not gonna let it happen to me, no
Winter forever in this house, they're   Rotting out from the inside...rotting out.
So put me out of my misery  Shove all your problems under the rug
If it ever happens to me, no    Not gonna let it happen to me, no
Rotting out from the inside...rotting out   Winter forever in this house, they're
Rotting out...Rotting out   Rotting out from the inside...rotting out
Beat my head till I can speak   So put me out of my misery
Not gonna let it happen to me, no   If it ever happens to me, no
I am alone in a stranger's bad dream    Is my imagination the only meaning?
I don't know what any of this means I see the the signals, I feel the world bending
I see the the signals, I feel the world bending In any moment, it's breaking around me
In any moment, it's breaking around me  Everyone is over....
It's a matter of time   What ya gonna to do if I step out of line?
What ya gonna to do if I step out of line?  Everyone is over....
I'm crossing fingers and hoping life works out  I'm crossing rivers, and hoping I don't drown.
I'm crossing rivers, and hoping I don't drown.  I'm crossing fingers and hoping life works out
I see the imitation, I feel the ending  In any moment, it's breaking around me
Tell me what it means   I see the the signals, I feel the world bending
Is my imagination the only meaning? It's all in my mind
Everyone is over. Everyone is overcome. It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind Tell me what it means
Outside the barracks by the corner light    The whole night through, was there that you'd whisper tenderly
Darling I remember how I'd wait for you at night    I'd give you a rose to show I care,
There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you I'd give you a rose to show I care,
The whole night through, was there that you'd whisper tenderly  There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you
That you loved me, you'd always be  There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you
Be my Lili Marlene, be my Lili Marlene  My Lili of the lamplight, my own Lili Marlene
I'd give you a rose to show I care, There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you
And wind it through your golden hair    Be my Lili Marlene, be my Lili Marlene
Then we would say goodnight and part,   There we'd create a world for two, I'd wait for you
I'll always keep you in my heart    Darling I remember how I'd wait for you at night
With me Lili Marlene, with me Lili Marlene  I'd give you a rose to show I care,
On a long lonesome journey I'm going    And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars
Oh darling, and please don't you cry    And I long for your kisses in vain
Though in shackles and chains they will take me Oh darling, and please don't you cry
In prison to stay till I die    And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars
And at night through the bars, I gaze at the stars  Put your arms through these bars once, my darlin'
And I long for your kisses in vain  The plans that we made were in vain
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow   On a long lonesome journey I'm going
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains   Though in shackles and chains they will take me
Put your arms through these bars once, my darlin'   And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars
Let me kiss those sweet lips that I love best   And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars
In heartache, you're my consolation On a long lonesome journey I'm going
In sorrow, my haven of rest While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains
And at night through the bars, I will gaze at the stars A piece of stone I will use as my pillow
The plans that we made were in vain Oh darling, and please don't you cry
A piece of stone I will use as my pillow    On a long lonesome journey I'm going
It was somewhere around Sheffield where my conscious concedes   What is the sound of something trying not to make a sound?
Fiction halts, the drugs began to wear thin, oh Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh
Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt   Fiction halts, the drugs began to wear thin, oh
Waking up each night from the gravitational pull    It was somewhere around Sheffield where my conscious concedes
What is the sound of something trying not to make a sound?  Will everybody wake up before it gets too late?
So sick of all the same old shit, so spent on being sick    Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious
Will everybody wake up before it gets too late? This show has been going downhill since season one
Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious    Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt
Always afraid, afraid of what the truth may bring, oh   Fiction halts, the drugs began to wear thin, oh
The last horse has finally crossed the finish line, yeah    This show has been going downhill since season one
Long and clever titles doesn't bring a clever song  What is the sound of something trying not to make a sound?
This show has been going downhill since season one  Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious
Just an open book reading itself to sleep   Ghost wrote in the middle of the night, chocking and obvious
Undone in the middle of the night, stinkingly obvious   Colored obvious, the world slid off it's tilt
Seen how you treat her  Don't wanna turn out like you
Don't wanna turn out like you   Words in a darkened hallway
So well adjusted    The last seventeen years of my life
You leave me feeling confused   Cracks in the in mirror
I've wasted You know the things that kids say
The last seventeen years of my life You know the things that kids say
I'm not going back  Under the carpet
But I'm not gonna run away  There's nothing left in my home
Anymore You know the things that kids say
Not anymore Spending December alone
Under the carpet    Cracks in the in mirror
You know the things that kids say   Cracks in the in mirror
Cracks in the in mirror Under the carpet
Words in a darkened hallway The last seventeen years of my life
All I remember  There's nothing left in my home
Spending December alone Seen how you treat her
Blank photo pages   I've wasted
You don't want to know  But maybe tomorrow
But that won't stop me from showing I want to be faithful
For nights I drank too much I'm good enough to wait for you
And words exchanged in the morning  You'll wake up to find out
For always pushing my luck  What are you so afraid of
Expecting you to keep waiting   I'm not doing so well...thus far
I want to be faithful   And ask where that one came from
But as far as I can tell    I'm not doing so well...thus far
I'm not doing so well...thus far    But as far as I can tell
But maybe tomorrow  For nights I drank too much
You'll wake up to find out  Expecting you to keep waiting
If I'm not good enough for now  I'm good enough to wait for you
I'm good enough to wait for you If I'm not good enough for now
What have you been told And ask where that one came from
What are you so afraid of   What have you been told
Should I be so bold You don't want to know
I'd like to love you , with all of my heart And it's in your smile, and it's in the way
You've had me on your trip, right from the start    I've found something new girl, just by looking at you
And when you looked at me, with love in your eyes   You've had me on your trip, right from the start
I knew I'd want you, oh yeah    You've had me on your trip, right from the start
I'd like to hold you, if you want me to I've found something new girl, just by looking at you
I've found something new girl, just by looking at you   You've had me on your trip, right from the start
And it's in your smile, and it's in the way You've had me on your trip, right from the start
I meet so many people, I feel I don't know  The place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mind
But I felt so close to you, when you said hello And when you looked at me, with love in your eyes
I'd like to love you, and together we'd find    I've found something new girl, just by looking at you
The place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mind  I knew I'd want you, oh yeah
There we'll be happy, and there I'll know why   And it's in your smile, and it's in the way
Chosen thing, I have become The poisoned ground, I've fallen in.
Broken stave, and overrun.  Servant to, what's offering,
In my dying time my wounds shall all be healed. In my dying time, you're all that is real.
Servant to, what's offering,    The poisoned ground, I've fallen in.
The poisoned ground, I've fallen in.    Servant to, what's offering,
In my dying time, you're all that is real.  In my dying time, my wounds shall all be healed.
